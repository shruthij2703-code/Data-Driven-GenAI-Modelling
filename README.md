# Python OOP and Programming Basics

This repository contains Python programs demonstrating **basic programming concepts** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles through simple, real-life examples. It is suitable for **beginners**, **students**, and **academic assignments**.

---

## 📌 Contents

### 🔹 TASK 1: Basic Operations Using Functions

This task demonstrates how to define and use functions in Python.

* **Area of a Circle**
* **Perimeter of a Rectangle**

**Concepts covered:**

* Functions
* Parameters and return values

---

### 🔹 TASK 2: Object and Class (Real-Life Use Case)

This task uses a `Person` class to represent a real-life object with attributes and behaviors.

**Features:**

* Attributes: name, height, weight, studying status
* Methods: age display, study status, height & weight details
* Multiple objects created from the same class

**Concepts covered:**

* Class and Object
* Constructor (`__init__`)
* Instance methods
* `__str__` method

---

### 🔹 TASK 3: Smart Vehicle Management System

This task demonstrates **Inheritance** and **Polymorphism** using a vehicle management system.

**Vehicle Types Implemented:**

* Car
* Plane
* Boat
* Drone

Each vehicle:

* Inherits from a base `Vehicle` class
* Implements its own version of the `move()` method
* Determines whether it is active using `is_active()`

**Concepts covered:**

* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Method overriding
* Base and derived classes

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

* **Encapsulation:** Data stored inside classes
* **Abstraction:** Common behavior defined in base classes
* **Inheritance:** Child classes reuse parent class features
* **Polymorphism:** Same method behaves differently for different objects

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

1. Make sure Python is installed (Python 3 recommended)
2. Clone the repository
3. Run the Python file:

```bash
python filename.py
```

---

## 🎯 Intended For

# Decision Tree and Random Forest – Real-Time Examples

This repository demonstrates **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** machine learning algorithms using **simple, real-time examples** with Python. The examples are designed for **beginners**, **students**, and **academic lab work**.

---

## 📌 Algorithms Covered

### 🌳 Decision Tree

A Decision Tree makes decisions by asking a series of questions and splitting data based on conditions until a final outcome is reached.

### 🌲🌲 Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees and gives the final output using **majority voting**.

---

## 🔹 Decision Tree Example

### 🎯 Use Case: Student Exam Result Prediction

The model predicts whether a student will **PASS or FAIL** based on:

* Study Hours
* Attendance Percentage

**Why Decision Tree?**

* Easy to understand
* Visual decision-making
* Suitable for rule-based problems

**Output:**

* PASS or FAIL

---

## 🔹 Random Forest Example

### 🎯 Use Case: Spam Email Detection

The model classifies emails as **SPAM or NOT SPAM** using:

* Presence of keywords (e.g., "FREE")
* Number of links
* Sender information

**Why Random Forest?**

* Uses multiple decision trees
* Reduces overfitting
* More accurate than a single decision tree

**Output:**

* SPAM or NOT SPAM

## 🧠 Key Differences

| Feature         | Decision Tree | Random Forest |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Number of Trees | One           | Multiple      |
| Accuracy        | Moderate      | High          |
| Overfitting     | Possible      | Reduced       |
| Complexity      | Simple        | Moderate      |

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Programs

1. Install Python (version 3.x recommended)
2. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

3. Run the Python files:

```bash
python decision_tree.py
python random_forest.py
```
